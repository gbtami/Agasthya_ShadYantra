# Vision

Our vision is to promote the dying indoor board game "Shad Yantra" created 8500 by sage Agasthya and then modified by Kautilya 2300 yrs ago and named as "ShatRanjan". (Not to be confused with Shatranj which is Arabic/Persian name.)

Our objective is to make the online version of this game to be played between two players.

Please go through the  [Wikis](https://github.com/ShadYantra/Agasthya_ShadYantra/wiki)
 to understand about its history and game.

This is a great effort for the Indian Chess Community, and donations or assistance in any form are welcome.

Suggestions and Feedbacks are welcome.
